            Beacon is an open standard for genomics data discovery, developed by members of the <a href="http://genomicsandhealth.org">Global Alliance for Genomics & Health</a>
            <br><br>
            The Beacon project is a project to test the willingness of international sites to share genetic data in the simplest of all technical contexts. It is defined as a simple public web service that any institution can implement as a service. <BR><BR>
            The service is designed merely to accept a query of the form "Do you have any genomes with an 'A' at position 100,735 on chromosome 3" (or similar data) and responds with one of "Yes" or "No." A site offering this service is called a "beacon". <BR><BR>
            This open web service is designed to be technically simple, easy to implement, and to not return privacy violating information.
            <BR><BR><BR><BR>
            The Beacon protocol was designed to be :
            <li>Simple 
            <li>Federated : maintained by individual organizations and assembled into a  network.
            <li>General-purpose : used to distribute any allelic dataset.
            <li>Aggregative : provide a boolean answer to whether an allele was observed.
