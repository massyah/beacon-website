      <p>
        In the nucleus of trillions of cells in your body, there are 23 pairs of chromosomes that comprise a genome. There
        are about 6 billion letters in a human genome, that collectively spell out a sort of molecular blueprint. A mutation of just
        a single letter in that genetic blueprint can literally change your life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finding the genetic causes of disease has been described as trying to find a needle in a haystack. Our mission is to
        develop cutting-edge technologies that help scientists discover and treat the causes of genetic diseases, and hence our name.
