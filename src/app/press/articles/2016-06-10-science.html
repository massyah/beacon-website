<h2 class="h2">GA4GH presents vision, model for genomic and clinical data sharing</h2>

<p>
  TORONTO, CANADA (June 10, 2016) — In today’s Science, the Global Alliance for Genomics and
  Health (GA4GH) calls for a federated data ecosystem for sharing genomic and clinical data. The
  authorship, which includes DNAstack CEO and co-founder Marc Fiume, as well as a diverse team of
  international leaders in academia, research, medicine, and industry, argues that a common framework of
  principles, protocols, and interoperable technical systems are necessary to enable responsible and
  effective data sharing.
</p>

<p>
  GA4GH was established in 2013 to bring the community together to build the tools and establish the
  standards necessary to achieve that goal. Today, it counts more than 400 organizations and more than
  700 individuals in its membership, which spans more than 70 countries. &quot;These stakeholders are working
  together across traditional boundaries to create the common framework that will allow us to make best
  use of the millions of genome sequences that currently sit in siloed databases around the globe,&quot; says
  Peter Goodhand, GA4GH Executive Director and a member of the author group.

<p>
  &quot;The seminal work conducted by the GA4GH paves the way for an information highway in genomics that will
  connect a global network of data sharing organizations to accelerate discoveries in genomics research and
  the delivery of precision medicine,&quot; says Fiume, who is also Project Lead on the GA4GH Beacon Project.
</p>

<p>
  To date, GA4GH has created a toolkit of diverse products, including the Genomics API, which allows
  disparate technology services to exchange genotypic and phenotypic data, as well as the Framework for
  Responsible Sharing of Genomic and Health Related Data, which outlines the basic principles and core
  elements for responsible data sharing. GA4GH has also catalyzed the development of three data sharing
  projects which aim to illustrate the value of sharing data in real world contexts. These consist of (i) an
  open-ended approach to sharing data across the Internet (the Beacon Project), (ii) an international
  collaboration among breast cancer genetics experts (the BRCA Challenge), and (iii) a peer-to- peer
  network of clinicians (Matchmaker Exchange).

  In addition to outlining successes, the paper notes a variety of remaining challenges to sharing data
  across national and institutional boundaries. For example, the membership is currently working on
  solutions to secure data access while maximizing the scope of information that can be shared, to create
  tools that are flexible enough to be readily implemented in different knowledge domains, and to establish
  sustainable funding models that support data curation, hosting, and computation.
</p>

<p>
  &quot;Private funders and national governments will need to be involved on some level to support these
  activities so that clinicians and scientists may access as much free, curated data as possible,&quot; says
  Mike Stratton, Director of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, CEO of the Wellcome Genome Campus, and a
  member of the GA4GH Strategic Advisory Board. &quot;The Sanger Institute has supported the Global Alliance
  since its inception as we are committed to helping researchers and clinicians access and freely share the
  genomic and related health data they need to transform human health.&quot;
</p>

<p>
  &quot;Millions of genome sequences are being generated around the globe, but to gain the full benefits from
  these data — to advance human health and to prevent and treat disease — laboratory and clinical
  investigators will need more effective means of access to data, regardless of where the data are stored,&quot;
  said Professor Harold Varmus of Weill Cornell Medical College, former Director of the U.S. National
  Cancer Institute, and Chair of the GA4GH Scientific Advisory Board. &quot;The only way to do that is for the
  global community to come together across traditional boundaries — be they national, institutional, or
  technical — to create a federated ecosystem that works for everyone. The GA4GH has begun to do that
  in the projects described in this new report.&quot;
</p>

<p>
  The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health is an international, non-profit alliance formed to accelerate
  the potential of genomic medicine to advance human health. Bringing together over 400 leading
  organizations working in healthcare, research, disease and patient advocacy, life science, and
  information technology, GA4GH Members are working together to create a common framework of tools,
  methods, and harmonized approaches and supporting demonstration projects to enable the responsible,
  voluntary, and secure sharing of genomic and clinical data.
